![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aff0df5a-bd8d-462e-a350-3ee96eea69ef)

### Objective
 The objective of this task is to create a basic program that can read code from a file and pick out important parts like:

 - Keywords (like int, if, while)

 - Operators (like +, -, =)

 - Identifiers (like variable names)


### Key Activities

  - Reads a code file

  - Scans each line of the code

  - Identifies and separates:

    . Keywords (e.g., int, if, return)

    . Operators (e.g., +, -, =)

    . Identifiers (e.g., variable names like x, count)

  - displays or prints the tokens it finds.

### Technoloiges Used
1. Programming Language:

   - C Language 

 2. File Handling (in C):

   - Reading an input file containing source code

   - Using functions like fopen(), fgets(), fscanf() to read code line by line

### Key Insight 
> Understanding how a compiler starts working by breaking code into basic components called tokens.
